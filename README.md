# ðŸ“„ Smart Contract: helloWorld
This is a simple example of an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It demonstrates basic contract structure, a constructor, and a simple function that returns a string.
--

# ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle)
##
# ðŸ§± Contract Structure
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
 - This line specifies the software license for the contract.
- UNLICENSED means the contract is not open-source and cannot be reused without permission.
##
pragma solidity ^0.8.30;
- Declares the Solidity compiler version required to compile the contract.
- Ensures compatibility with Solidity version 0.8.30 or higher (but not 0.9.0+).
##
contract helloWorld {
- Defines a new smart contract named helloWorld.
##
# ðŸš€ Constructor
 constructor() payable {
    // This is a comment
}
- This is a constructor â€” a special function that runs once when the contract is deployed.
- payable means the contract can receive Ether when deployed.
- Currently, it does nothing except allow Ether to be sent during deployment.
##
# ðŸ’¬ Public Function
function hello() public pure returns (string memory) {
    return "Hello World!";
}
- hello() is a public function, meaning it can be called externally (by anyone).
- pure means it does not read or modify the blockchain state.
- It returns a string stored in memory: "Hello World!".

# âœ… Usage
- After deploying the contract, you can call the hello() function to get the response:

# "Hello World!"
